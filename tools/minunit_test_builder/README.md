# MinUnit Test Builder
This folder contains all a simple bash script that searches for tests in the `source/app` folder for `.test.c` files and builds a simple test code wrapper around it.

## Usage
Simply call `./build_main_test_file.sh` from your terminal. You can give it an optional argument for the location of the source files. It will output a  `main.c` file for you.
